Utilizing Vite's [`loadEnv`](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#loadenv) function, this CLI tool loads `.env` files and spawns a child-process with those environment variables. This is useful when you want to adopt Vite's mode handling with other tools.

**Features**

- limit to prefixed environment variables, e.g. `VITE_`
- expand environment variables
- isolation of host enviroment variables

## Installation üíø

```shell
npm install loadenv-cli
```

## Usage üöÄ

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to get familiar with Vite's concept of [Environment Variables and Modes](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) before using the CLI.

**Example**

```sh
# Use production .env with Playwright
npx loadenv --mode production playwright test

# Only pass prefixed environment variables
npx loadenv --mode production --prefix VITE_ playwright test

# Pass arguments to Playwright
npx loadenv --mode production --prefix VITE_ playwright test -- --ui
```

See `loadenv --help` for all available options.
